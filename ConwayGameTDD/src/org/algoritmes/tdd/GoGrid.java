	 * Based on TDD Kata 
	 * https://gojko.net/2009/02/27/thought-provoking-tdd-exercise-at-the-software-craftsmanship-conference/
	 * 
			Attendees were split into pairs who were working on the task together, using TDD practices with very strict rules:
			
			1) write exactly ONE failing test
			2) make the test from (1) pass by first writing implementation code IN THE TEST
			3) create a new implementation method/function by:
			     doing extract method on implementation code created as per (2), or
			     moving implementation code as per (2) into an existing implementation method
			4) only ever create new methods IN THE TEST CLASS
			5) only ever create implementation classes to provide a destination for extracting a method created as per (4).
			6)populate implementation classes by doing move method from a test class into them
			7) refactor as required
			8) go to (1)
